            <summary>
            Monitors all DiagnosticSource events and exposes them as Prometheus counters.
            The event data is discarded, only the number of occurrences is measured.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This is a very coarse data set due to lacking any intelligence on the payload.
            Users are recommended to make custom adapters with more detail for specific use cases.

            <summary>
            By default we subscribe to all listeners but this allows you to filter by listener.
